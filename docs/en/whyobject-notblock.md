# Why object storage and not block storage?

1. the base of the data lake is object storage;

2. the base of AI is also object storage;

3. more than 95% of data in the context of storage-accounting separation is unstructured data;

4. In addition to special scenarios such as databases, users are more concerned about files;


Therefore, we choose to re-object storage.
