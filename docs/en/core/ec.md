# Difference Between Multiple Replication and Erasure Coding in Object Storage
Multiple Replication and Erasure Coding in object storage are two distinct data redundancy strategies designed to ensure data reliability and availability. Here are the main differences between the two:
### 1.1 Multiple Replication:
1. **Principle**:
   - Data is replicated multiple times, with each copy stored in a different location (usually on different servers or data centers).
   
2. **Redundancy**:
   - High redundancy, typically three copies, meaning the data is stored three times.
3. **Read/Write Performance**:
   - Good read performance, as data can be read from any of the copies.
   - Lower write performance, as all copies need to be written simultaneously.
4. **Space Utilization**:
   - Low space utilization, as the amount of stored data is multiple times the original data volume.
5. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Can tolerate the loss of multiple copies simultaneously, depending on the number of replicas.
6. **Recovery Speed**:
   - Fast recovery, as it only requires replicating the lost copy.
### 1.2 Erasure Coding:
1. **Principle**:
   - Data is split into multiple fragments, and then coding algorithms generate parity fragments, which are stored along with the original data fragments.
   
2. **Redundancy**:
   - Relative low redundancy, usually 1/N of the original data volume, where N is the redundancy factor of the erasure code.
3. **Read/Write Performance**:
   - Poor read performance, as it requires reading data fragments from multiple locations and decoding them.
   - Poor write performance, as it necessitates calculating and storing additional parity fragments.
4. **Space Utilization**:
   - High space utilization, as only a small amount of parity data needs to be stored.
5. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Can tolerate the loss or damage of a certain number of data fragments, depending on the design of the erasure code.
6. **Recovery Speed**:
   - Slower recovery, as it requires reconstructing lost data using the remaining data and parity fragments.
### 1.3 Summary:
- **Multiple Replication** is suitable for scenarios that require high read/write performance and have ample storage space. The risk of data loss with typical three-replica configurations in distributed environments is often higher than with a 50% erasure code.
- **Erasure Coding** is suitable for scenarios that demand high storage efficiency and can tolerate a decrease in read/write performance.

# Which Storage Security Technology Does RustFS Use?

In the case of large-scale storage, the disk utilization rate for three replicas is 33%, whereas the utilization rate for erasure coding at 50% is also safer than multiple replication.
Using both multiple replication and erasure coding in distributed storage is a waste for programmers and increases the complexity of system design.
Therefore, RustFS uses a simpler and safer erasure coding technology.
