# I. What is Centralized Storage?
Centralized storage is a data storage architecture where all storage resources are managed and controlled from a central location. In this architecture, storage devices are typically located in a single physical location, with storage management functions handled by a centralized storage controller or storage server. The main features of centralized storage include:
1. **Data Storage**: All data is stored on a central server or storage device.
2. **Data Management**: Data is managed and maintained through the central server.
3. **Data Access Speed**: Faster data access speeds can be provided since the data is stored on a central server.
4. **Advantages**: Simple management, high security, unified management.
5. **Disadvantages**: Risk of single point of failure, poor scalability.
The main types of centralized storage are as follows:
1. **Direct Attached Storage (DAS)**: Storage devices are directly connected to the server, suitable for small or single-server environments.
2. **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: Storage devices provide data and file services through a computer network, suitable for environments that require shared file access.
3. **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: Storage devices are connected to servers through a dedicated high-speed network, suitable for environments that require high-performance storage.
# II. What is Distributed Storage?
Distributed storage is a data storage technology that disperses data across multiple independent computers or servers, which work together over a network to form a unified storage system. Here are the main features and working principles of distributed storage:
### 2.1 Features of Distributed Storage
1. **Data Storage**: Information is stored across multiple independent and non-interfering devices connected through a network.
2. **High Reliability**: The system can still operate normally even if some nodes fail, as data is stored across multiple nodes.
3. **Scalability**: The distributed storage structure is easy to scale, allowing for the addition of more storage nodes as needed.
4. **High Performance**: Data can be read from and written to multiple nodes in parallel, improving read/write performance and throughput.
### 2.2 Working Principles of Distributed Storage
1. **Data Sharding**: Data is divided into multiple parts, each stored on different nodes, usually implemented using hash functions or consistent hashing algorithms.
2. **Replica Replication**: To improve data reliability and availability, each data replica is stored on different nodes, ensuring data can be recovered from other nodes.
3. **Data Consistency**: Distributed storage systems use data synchronization and management mechanisms, such as Paxos, Raft, or ZooKeeper, to ensure consistency across different nodes.
4. **Data Access**: Efficient data access is achieved through load balancing mechanisms, such as distributed hash tables, distributed caching, or distributed file systems.
### 2.3 Advantages of Distributed Storage
1. **Compliance**: Facilitates data sharing both domestically and internationally while complying with regulations.
2. **Security**: The absence of a central server reduces the risk of attack.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Data stored across multiple devices means that a single point of failure does not affect the entire system.
4. **Privacy**: Data files are split and encrypted for storage, enhancing privacy protection.
5. **Reduced Energy Costs**: No need to build large data centers, reducing energy consumption.
Compared to centralized storage, distributed storage may be more complex in terms of data management and updates due to the involvement of multiple databases. However, it has clear advantages in terms of data access efficiency, system fault tolerance, and scalability.
# III. What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Centralized and Distributed Storage?
Centralized and distributed storage are two different data storage architectures, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages:
### 3.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Centralized Storage
#### Advantages
1. **Simple Management**: Management and maintenance are relatively easy since all data is stored in one central location.
2. **High Security**: Centralized control makes it easier to implement security policies and access controls.
3. **Fast Data Access Speed**: Data stored on the central server can be accessed quickly.
4. **Unified Management**: Convenient for unified monitoring and backup.
#### Disadvantages
1. **Risk of Single Point of Failure**: The entire system may fail if the central server or storage device malfunctions.
2. **Poor Scalability**: The scalability of the central server may be limited as data volume increases.
3. **Cost**: The cost of establishing and maintaining a large central storage system may be high.

### 3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributed Storage
#### Advantages
1. **High Reliability**: Data is distributed across multiple nodes, allowing the system to continue functioning normally even if some nodes fail.
2. **Scalability**: Storage nodes can be easily added as needed, making it suitable for large-scale data storage.
3. **High Performance**: Parallel reading and writing of data across multiple nodes enhances performance and throughput.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: The system has self-healing capabilities and can handle node failures.
5. **Reduced Energy Costs**: There is no need to build and maintain large data centers.
   
#### Disadvantages
1. **Complex Data Management and Updates**: Managing and synchronizing data across multiple nodes and databases is complex.
2. **Consistency Maintenance**: Maintaining data consistency across all nodes requires complex algorithms and protocols.
3. **Network Dependency**: Distributed storage heavily relies on the network; network issues can affect storage performance.
4. **Cost**: While the cost of expansion is low, the initial cost of establishing and maintaining a distributed system can be high.
5. **Technical Difficulty and Threshold**: Distributed storage is more secure, but it also has a higher technical difficulty and entry barrier.
# IV. What is RustFS - Centralized or Distributed Storage?
RustFS can be used for centralized storage with single-machine single-disk or single-machine multi-disk configurations. It can also be built into a distributed storage system to achieve high data reliability and availability.
