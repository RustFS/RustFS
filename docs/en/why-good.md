# How will the benefits of MinIO continue?

We will continue to keep the benefits of MinIO for RustFS.

1. simplicity;
2. speed;
3. no metadata center risk;
4. ease of scaling;
5. ease of decommissioning;
6. S3 compatible;
7. data lake and AI compatibility;
8. lifecycle management;
9. bucket replication;
